Event management is the application of project management to the creation and development of small and/or large-scale personal or corporate events such as festivals, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or conventions.

# Project Description:

An event is a complete overview of the event you are planning to run. Written before any practical plans are made and long before the date of the event. It includes any details relevant to the event and how you expect it to run such as key dates, limitations etc.

Event management is a process of organizing a professional and focused event, for a particular target audience. It involves visualizing concepts, planning, budgeting, organizing and executing events such as wedding, musical concerts, corporate seminars, exhibitions, birthday celebrations, theme parties, etc.
